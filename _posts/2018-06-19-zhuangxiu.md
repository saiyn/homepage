# Feynman Technique

<br />

The famous Nobel winning physicist Richard Feynman understood the difference betweent knowing something and knowing the name of something and it's one of the most importand reasons for his success.

He created a formula for learning that ensured he understood something better than everyone else.It's called the *Feynman Technique*.

There are four steps to the Feynamn Technique.

<br />

## Step 1:Teach it to a child

<br />

A lot of people tend to use compicated vocabulary and jargon to mask when they don't understand something.
The problem is we only fool ourselves because we don't know that we don't understand.

When you write out an idea from start to finish in simple language that a child can understand, you force yourself to understand 
the concept at d deeper level and simplify relationships and connections between ideas.

<br />

## Step 2:Review

<br />

In step one, you will inevitably encounter gaps in your knowledge where you're forgetting something important, are not able to explain
it, or simply have trouble connecting an important concept.

This is invaluable feedback because you're discovered the edge of your knowledge.

This iw where the learning starts.Now you know where you got stuck, go back to the soure material and re-learn it until you can explain it in basic terms.

<br />

## Step 3:Organize and simplify

<br />

Now you have a set of hand-crafted notes.Review them to make sure you didn't mistakenly borrow any of the jargon from the source material.Organize then into a simple story that flows.

<br />

## Step 4(optional):Transmit

<br />

If you really want to be sure of your understanding, run it past someone.The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey
it to another.
